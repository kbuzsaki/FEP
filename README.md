The Fire Emblem Project
===

The Fire Emblem Project is a recreation of the game engine of the Game Boy 
Advance game "Fire Emblem" in java. 

FEP was originally started in Spring of 2011, I worked on it sporadically for
two years. Finally, in Spring of 2013, the crushing weight of the technical debt
that was the result of my "learning as I went" in terms of design convinced me
to start from scratch.

This is FEP version 2.
